This is the layout for the Specification page, This layout is the first layout that the users see.

For now, this layout uses a simple relative layout. This allows for all of the items to be
easily placed on the page.

The colour for the background has also been set to one of the "default" values that we have set for this app
-->

    <!--
    This is the image view... This is the main image that is displayed on the screen
    This image has had some hard codded values for the width, height, margin left and margin right

    The image for this is under the src : @drawable/spec_page_main_image

    <!--
    The next three Image views display the same image.
    These display white boxes... These will simply hold some key information of the cars
    This information within these boxes will also change once the slide changes

    Just like the main image, these all have hard codded widths, heights and margin lefts
    These views do have one different element however. They are set to margin top...

    These have been set to margin top because they have been hard codded to be positioned
    underneath the main image that is displayed above.

    **
       All three of these have been given the same dimensions...
       If one is changed, change all three to match.

    This is the image that displays the line with the text that says find out more

    This is here to inform the users that they are able to find out more about the car
    that is there in front of them.

    As on this page it became too complicated to change this view into a clickable object it has
    just been set as a normal image for now. The on click function is added by an invisible button
    placed over the top of this image. This can be found below this.
